This is a website that lets a user stake sepoliaETH to be able to take part in a voting system. 
Only the admin can create proposals but anyone else who has staked can vote on what to do with the tokens i the pool.

Will soon be up on GH-pages. For now, open the project, go to the frontend folder and run the command "npm install" and the run "npm run dev". Follow the link.

OBS: You need Metamask browser wallet and sepoliaETH in your wallet to use the website.
